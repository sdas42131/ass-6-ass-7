// 10.	Read p, q, r, a, b, c. Let ax+by+c=0 be a line. Let (p,q) be the center of a circle and r be its radius. The program finds whether the circle and the line intersect or not. If they intersect let A and B be the points of intersection of the circle and the line. Find the area of the triangle formed by A, B and the center of the circle. [Hint: Find the distance of the line from the center.  If it is more than the radius then circle and the line do not intersect. Otherwise find the chord length AB]. Input 5 4 10 1 1 2   “no intersection”. Input 7 4 13 3 4 23 60.
